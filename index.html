                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>Hello, I'm Francis De Leon, a motivated individual from Pangasinan, Philippines. I hold a Senior High diploma from PSU (Pangasinan State University) and am currently pursuing my college education at PHINMA UPANG Dagupan. My fascination with video games sparked my interest in computers, and I've since honed my technical skills. Beyond the screen, I find joy in exploring cinematic narratives, maintaining an active lifestyle through gym sessions, and starting each day with a brisk morning walk. Rooted in Stoicism, I believe in seeking contentment and tranquility in life. My peers often describe me as creatively unconventional, with a tendency to engage in contemplation. Embracing the words, "To win TRUE freedom one must be a slave to philosophy," I value profound thinking as a pathway to personal growth. I am dedicated to achieving a state of harmony and fulfillment within myself and in my interactions with the world around me.</p>
